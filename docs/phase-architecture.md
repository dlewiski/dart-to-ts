# Phase Architecture: Dart-to-TypeScript Transformation

## Overview

The Dart-to-TypeScript transformation is designed as a multi-phase system with clear separation of concerns. Each phase has distinct responsibilities and well-defined input/output contracts.

## Phase Boundaries

### Phase 1: Deep Analysis & Understanding (Current)

**Responsibility**: Comprehensive analysis of Dart codebase functionality

**Focus**: 
- What does the application do?
- How is it structured?
- What patterns are used?
- What are the core features?

**Approach**:
- Pure analysis with no conversion assumptions
- Understanding-first, solution-neutral
- Pattern detection without prescription

**Input**: Dart project files and structure

**Output**: `Phase1Output`
```typescript
interface Phase1Output {
  analysis: FunctionalAnalysis;      // Core functionality understanding
  categories: FileCategories;        // File organization structure  
  chunks: CodeChunk[];              // Analyzed code segments
  metadata: AnalysisMetadata;       // Analysis context and quality metrics
}
```

**Key Modules**:
- `src/scanner.ts` - Project structure discovery
- `src/extractor.ts` - Code chunk preparation
- `src/analyzer.ts` - Functionality analysis
- `src/services/analysis-service.ts` - Orchestration

---

### Phase 2: Migration Strategy Planning (Future)

**Responsibility**: Intelligent migration strategy determination

**Focus**:
- How should we migrate this specific codebase?
- What TypeScript patterns best match the Dart patterns?
- Which dependencies and architectures are optimal?
- What are the migration risks and considerations?

**Approach**:
- LLM-driven strategy selection based on Phase 1 analysis
- Adaptive decision-making for each unique codebase
- Context-aware recommendations
- No hardcoded conversion rules

**Input**: `Phase1Output` from Phase 1

**Output**: `MigrationPlan`
```typescript
interface MigrationPlan {
  strategy: MigrationStrategy;           // Overall migration approach
  dependencies: DependencyMapping;       // Package migration decisions
  architecture: ArchitecturalPlan;       // Structure and patterns
  phases: MigrationPhase[];             // Step-by-step execution plan
  risks: RiskAssessment[];             // Identified challenges
  recommendations: string[];            // Best practices for this project
}
```

**Planned Modules**:
- `src/migration/StrategyAnalyzer.ts` - LLM-driven strategy selection
- `src/migration/MigrationPlanner.ts` - Creates migration plan
- `src/migration/patterns/PatternDetector.ts` - Dart pattern analysis
- `src/migration/patterns/PatternMapper.ts` - TypeScript pattern mapping

---

### Phase 3: Code Generation (Future)

**Responsibility**: Actual TypeScript code generation

**Focus**:
- Generate TypeScript code based on migration plan
- Preserve functionality while modernizing patterns
- Create project structure and configuration

**Input**: `MigrationPlan` from Phase 2 + original Dart code

**Output**: Generated TypeScript project

## Design Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility
Each phase has one clear purpose and cannot be bypassed or conflated with others.

### 2. Clean Interfaces
Well-defined TypeScript interfaces govern data exchange between phases.

### 3. Flexibility Over Prescription
Later phases use LLM analysis to adapt to each unique codebase rather than applying rigid rules.

### 4. Testable Architecture
Each phase can be developed, tested, and validated independently.

### 5. Incremental Development
Phases can be developed iteratively without breaking existing functionality.

## Current State

**Phase 1**: âœ… Complete and production-ready
- Comprehensive Dart project analysis
- Structured output with rich metadata
- Caching and performance optimization
- Parallel processing support

**Phase 2**: ðŸš§ Architecture defined, implementation pending
- Module structure planned
- Type interfaces designed
- LLM integration approach documented

**Phase 3**: ðŸ“‹ Planned for future development

## Migration from Current Architecture

The current system already follows good phase separation. The main changes needed:

1. **Remove prescriptive elements** from Phase 1 (like hardcoded `tsEquivalents`)
2. **Create Phase 2 module structure** for future development
3. **Define clear type contracts** between phases
4. **Document the separation** (this document)

This maintains backward compatibility while setting up clean architecture for future phases.

## Benefits

- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries make code easier to understand and modify
- **Testability**: Each phase can be unit tested independently
- **Flexibility**: Phase 2 can adapt strategies based on Phase 1 findings
- **Scalability**: New phases can be added without refactoring existing ones
- **Debugging**: Issues can be isolated to specific phases
- **Collaboration**: Teams can work on different phases simultaneously
