# Phase 2: Migration Strategy Planning

## Overview

Phase 2 takes the comprehensive understanding generated in Phase 1 and uses LLM-driven analysis to determine the optimal TypeScript migration strategy for each unique Dart codebase.

## Core Philosophy

### Adaptive, Not Prescriptive

Unlike traditional migration tools that apply rigid rules, Phase 2 adapts to each codebase's unique characteristics:

- **No hardcoded conversions**: The LLM evaluates patterns and context
- **Context-aware decisions**: Strategies change based on app complexity
- **Best-fit solutions**: Recommends frameworks and patterns that match the app's needs

### Understanding Before Deciding

Phase 2 only begins after Phase 1 has thoroughly analyzed:

- What the application does
- How it's structured
- What patterns it uses
- What business logic it implements
- What dependencies it relies on

## Strategy Selection Process

### 1. Pattern Analysis

The LLM analyzes patterns detected in Phase 1:

```typescript
// Example patterns from Phase 1
{
  stateManagement: {
    pattern: "Redux with middleware",
    complexity: "high",
    features: ["time-travel", "async-actions", "selectors"]
  }
}

// Phase 2 determines best TypeScript approach
{
  recommendation: "Redux Toolkit",
  rationale: "Maintains Redux patterns while modernizing with TypeScript",
  alternatives: ["Zustand", "MobX"],
  tradeoffs: {...}
}
```

### 2. Dependency Mapping

Rather than hardcoded mappings, the LLM evaluates each dependency:

```typescript
// Phase 1: Understanding
{
  coreDependencies: ["over_react", "redux", "built_value"],
  packageCategories: {
    ui_framework: ["over_react"],
    state_management: ["redux"],
    data_handling: ["built_value"]
  }
}

// Phase 2: Intelligent mapping
{
  packageMappings: {
    "over_react": "react + typescript",
    "redux": "@reduxjs/toolkit",
    "built_value": "immer + zod" // LLM decides based on usage patterns
  }
}
```

### 3. Architecture Selection

The LLM considers multiple factors:

- **Application size and complexity**
- **Team familiarity (if known)**
- **Performance requirements**
- **Existing patterns to preserve**
- **Modern best practices**

## Example Migration Strategies

### Simple Application

```typescript
// Phase 1 Analysis
{
  appPurpose: "Todo list with local storage",
  complexity: "low",
  stateManagement: { pattern: "simple Redux" }
}

// Phase 2 Strategy
{
  strategy: {
    approach: "incremental",
    architecture: "React + Context API",
    rationale: "Redux overhead not justified for simple state",
    tooling: "Vite + TypeScript"
  }
}
```

### Complex Enterprise Application

```typescript
// Phase 1 Analysis
{
  appPurpose: "Multi-tenant dashboard with real-time data",
  complexity: "high",
  stateManagement: { 
    pattern: "Redux with sagas",
    features: ["optimistic updates", "websockets", "caching"]
  }
}

// Phase 2 Strategy
{
  strategy: {
    approach: "strangler",
    architecture: "React + Redux Toolkit + RTK Query",
    rationale: "Preserves Redux patterns while modernizing async handling",
    phases: [
      "Core infrastructure setup",
      "Shared component migration",
      "Feature-by-feature migration",
      "Legacy cleanup"
    ]
  }
}
```

## LLM Decision Factors

### 1. Pattern Preservation vs. Modernization

The LLM balances:
- Maintaining familiar patterns for easier migration
- Introducing modern patterns for better maintainability
- Team learning curve considerations

### 2. Risk Assessment

For each strategy, the LLM evaluates:
- Technical complexity
- Migration effort
- Potential breaking changes
- Testing requirements
- Rollback capabilities

### 3. Dependency Ecosystem

The LLM considers:
- TypeScript ecosystem maturity
- Community support
- Long-term maintenance
- Security considerations
- Performance characteristics

## Output: Migration Plan

### Strategy Document

```typescript
interface MigrationPlan {
  // Overall approach
  strategy: {
    name: "Incremental Feature Migration",
    approach: "strangler",
    rationale: "Allows continuous delivery while migrating"
  },
  
  // Technical decisions
  architecture: {
    ui: "React 18 with TypeScript",
    state: "Redux Toolkit with RTK Query",
    styling: "CSS Modules with Tailwind",
    testing: "Vitest + React Testing Library"
  },
  
  // Step-by-step plan
  phases: [
    {
      name: "Infrastructure Setup",
      tasks: ["Setup Vite", "Configure TypeScript", "Setup testing"],
      duration: "1 week"
    },
    // ... more phases
  ],
  
  // Risk management
  risks: [
    {
      category: "high",
      description: "Complex state migration",
      mitigation: "Create adapter layer first"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Benefits of LLM-Driven Strategy

### 1. Contextual Intelligence

- Understands nuanced patterns beyond simple rules
- Considers multiple factors simultaneously
- Learns from latest best practices

### 2. Flexible Recommendations

- Provides multiple options with tradeoffs
- Adapts to project constraints
- Suggests phased approaches when appropriate

### 3. Comprehensive Planning

- Identifies potential issues early
- Provides detailed migration steps
- Includes risk mitigation strategies

## Future Enhancements

### Machine Learning Integration

- Learn from successful migrations
- Improve pattern recognition
- Refine strategy recommendations

### Interactive Planning

- Allow user input on constraints
- Iterate on strategy based on feedback
- Provide cost/time estimates

### Continuous Adaptation

- Update strategies based on new TypeScript features
- Incorporate community best practices
- Learn from migration outcomes

## Implementation Status

**Current State**: Architecture defined, awaiting implementation

**Next Steps**:
1. Implement LLM integration for strategy analysis
2. Create pattern detection algorithms
3. Build strategy generation system
4. Develop risk assessment framework
5. Create migration plan generator

## Summary

Phase 2 represents a paradigm shift in code migration:

- **From rigid rules** → **To adaptive intelligence**
- **From one-size-fits-all** → **To contextual solutions**
- **From blind conversion** → **To strategic transformation**

By leveraging LLM analysis, Phase 2 ensures each Dart application receives a migration strategy tailored to its unique characteristics, requirements, and constraints.
