# Follow-Up Tasks & Development Notes

## Project: Dart to TypeScript Converter v2

## Tasks

- [ ] Check for duplication between `src/claude-cli.ts` and `src/utils/claude-utils.ts` files - review and refactor if needed

---

‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement:

1. Business logic extraction was empty - No rules or validations were
   captured
2. User workflows could be more detailed - Only captured basic UI
   interactions
3. Data transformations are minimal - Only identified one
   transformation function
4. Missing component hierarchy - Doesn't show parent-child
   relationships

   üîß Areas for Improvement

5. Code Duplication Priority: Medium
   Issue: Potential overlap between src/claude-cli.ts and src/utils/claude-utils.ts
   Recommendation: Review and consolidate shared functionality as noted in docs/follow-up-tasks.md
6. Error Messaging Priority: Low
   Issue: Some generic error messages could be more specific
   Example: analyzer.ts:73-77 logs error details only in verbose mode
   Recommendation: Consider structured logging for better debugging
7. Type Safety Priority: Low
   Issue: Some unknown and any types in response handling
   Example: claude-cli.ts:212 returns unknown
   Recommendation: Create more specific response types
   üöÄ Performance Considerations
   Excellent Optimizations
   Smart chunking: Code splitting for large files (claude-utils.ts:110-140)
   Progress tracking: Real-time progress indicators for long operations
   Caching strategy: 2-hour TTL with proper cache invalidation
   Memory limits: 10MB output size limit prevents memory issues
   Potential Improvements
   Parallel processing: Could analyze multiple chunks concurrently
   Stream processing: For very large codebases, consider streaming analysis
   üß™ Test Coverage Assessment
   Current Status
   1 test file with 4 integration tests covering core functionality
   Good coverage of critical paths: prompt execution, JSON parsing, code analysis
   Realistic test data using actual Dart code examples
   Recommendations
   Add unit tests for individual components (scanner, extractor, utils)
   Test error scenarios and edge cases
   Add performance regression tests
   Consider adding property-based tests for JSON parsing
   üîí Security Analysis
   Well Implemented
   Process isolation: Secure subprocess management
   Input validation: File size and content constraints
   No shell injection: Safe command execution
   Timeout protection: Prevents resource exhaustion
   Minor Concerns
   Consider adding input sanitization for file paths
   May want to validate Claude CLI responses more strictly
   üìä Build & Dependencies
   Configuration Quality
   Modern TypeScript: Good tsconfig.json with strict mode
   Comprehensive ESLint: Proper rules for TypeScript and Prettier
   Clean dependencies: Minimal, focused dependency tree
   Proper scripts: Well-defined build and test commands
   üéØ Recommendations for Next Steps
   Address code duplication between CLI and utils modules
   Add unit tests for individual components
   Consider parallel processing for better performance
   Add integration with CI/CD for automated quality checks
   Document API contracts more thoroughly for external consumers
