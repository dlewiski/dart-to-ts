# Product Requirements Document: Phase 2 Migration Strategy Planning

## Executive Summary

The Phase 2 Migration Strategy Planning system is an intelligent, LLM-driven component that transforms comprehensive Dart codebase analysis into actionable TypeScript migration strategies. Unlike traditional rigid conversion tools, this system adapts to each codebase's unique characteristics, providing context-aware recommendations that balance pattern preservation with modernization. The system analyzes functional understanding from Phase 1 and produces detailed migration plans optimized for each specific application's needs, complexity, and constraints.

## Background & Context

### Current State

The Dart-to-TypeScript transformation system has successfully completed Phase 1, which provides deep functional analysis of Dart codebases. Organizations currently face significant challenges when migrating from Dart to TypeScript:

- Manual migration is time-consuming and error-prone
- Existing tools apply rigid, one-size-fits-all conversion rules
- No consideration for application-specific patterns or complexity
- Lack of strategic planning leads to failed or incomplete migrations
- Teams struggle to maintain business continuity during migration

### Business Need

Development teams need an intelligent system that:
- Understands their specific codebase patterns and complexity
- Recommends optimal TypeScript architectures and patterns
- Provides risk-assessed, phased migration approaches
- Balances modernization with familiar pattern preservation
- Generates actionable, detailed migration plans

### Success Vision

A system that enables organizations to confidently migrate Dart applications to TypeScript with:
- Reduced migration time by 60-80%
- Clear, risk-managed migration strategies
- Preservation of business logic integrity
- Modern TypeScript best practices adoption
- Minimal disruption to ongoing development

## Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals

1. **Adaptive Strategy Generation**: Create context-aware migration strategies based on codebase analysis
2. **Intelligent Dependency Mapping**: Map Dart packages to optimal TypeScript equivalents
3. **Architecture Planning**: Design TypeScript architectures that match application needs
4. **Risk Assessment**: Identify and mitigate migration risks proactively
5. **Phased Approach Planning**: Generate incremental migration plans for continuous delivery
6. **Pattern Recognition**: Detect Dart patterns and recommend TypeScript equivalents
7. **Tradeoff Analysis**: Provide clear rationale for technical decisions

### Non-Goals

1. **Code Generation**: Phase 2 does not generate actual TypeScript code (Phase 3 responsibility)
2. **Manual Intervention**: System will not require manual pattern mapping
3. **Build System Setup**: Will not configure build tools or CI/CD pipelines
4. **Runtime Migration**: Will not handle runtime data migration
5. **Testing Implementation**: Will not generate test code (recommendation only)
6. **Project Management**: Will not handle team coordination or resource allocation
