/**
 * Phase 2: Strategy Analyzer
 *
 * Uses LLM to analyze Phase 1 output and determine optimal migration strategies.
 * This is adaptive and context-aware - no hardcoded rules.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Evaluates Dart architectural patterns
 * - Considers application complexity and requirements
 * - Selects appropriate TypeScript frameworks and patterns
 * - Adapts to unique codebase characteristics
 *
 * FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION - Structure defined for phase boundaries
 */

/**
 * Analyzes Dart patterns and selects optimal TypeScript migration strategy
 *
 * This will be the core of Phase 2 - LLM-driven decision making based on
 * the deep understanding generated in Phase 1.
 *
 * Example logic (to be implemented):
 * - If Dart app uses Redux pattern -> recommend Redux Toolkit
 * - If heavy OverReact usage -> recommend React with TypeScript
 * - If complex state management -> recommend Zustand or Redux
 * - If simple app -> recommend lightweight React setup
 * - Etc. - but all decided dynamically by LLM analysis
